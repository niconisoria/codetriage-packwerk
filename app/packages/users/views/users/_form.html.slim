      p When you're busy we try to send you fewer emails, if that's not good enough set your desired frequency here. For example if you set "twice a week" you won't receive more than 2 emails a week.
      p How often should you get emails? It depends on your goals:
      ul.bullets
        li <strong>Daily:</strong><i> "I want to ramp up as fast as possible, I'm working towards becoming a committer ASAP."</i>
        li <strong>Twice a week:</strong></i> "Being a committer is still in my sights, but it doesn't need to be tomorrow."</i>
        li <strong>Once a week:</strong><i> "I might be a committer one day, but for now I only want to help out here and there."</i>
        li <strong>Once a month:</strong> <i>"I want to see casually what's going on and I want to help a tiny bit."</i>
      br
      p The most important thing is consistency. No matter the frequency you can commit to, keep clicking on issues, keep learning, and you'll get there!
